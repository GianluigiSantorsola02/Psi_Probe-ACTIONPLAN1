#summary Instructions for setting up the project in Eclipse (incomplete)
----

== Configure Eclipse for Maven and Web ==
  * Download [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] 3.5/3.6 and install the following plugins:
    * [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/ m2eclipse]
    * [http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/ wtp 2.0 plugin] (SpringSource STS or "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" recommended)

== Check Out PSI Probe Source ==

*WARNING:* Do NOT checkout the project from svn directly! In this case, you get a single project layout. As there are multiple tomcat connectors with different versions of the catalina library, you will get errors displayed within Eclipse, as Eclipse only supports a common Classpath within a single project.

How to checkout the project as a M2 Eclipse Project:
  # `File > Import > "Check out Maven Projects from SCM"`
  # Select svn and give the SVN url (e.g. for trunk, use http://psi-probe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/)
  # With this, m2eclipse creates a multi-Project layout.
    * Note: The error shown in the web module is caused by the JSP validator and can be ignored.
  # perform mvn eclipse:eclipse in the toplevel project dir.

Its recommended to create a Working Set (e.g. PSI-PROBE) where you move all sub-projects to.

== Compiling and Packaging PSI Probe from Source ==
  # Right-click on the "web" project.
  # Run as > Run on Server.
  # Choose an installed Tomcat Server instance or create one.
